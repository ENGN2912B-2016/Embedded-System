# I/O Preprocessing
This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the branches within the project. For ease of coding, the project has been divided to three branches- I/O handeling, Speech processing and GUI_development.

Pre-processing
    This branch currently contains coefficients for a bandpass FIR filter for noise reduction of input/output signals.

Speech Processing 
    This branch contains files with the main numerical computations for speech processing like calculation of Fast Fourier Transform           (FFT), windowing, energy in the frequency domain, dominant frequency component, and the spectral flatness measure.
    
GUI_dev
    This branch contains the project file that develops a GUI for Data Visualization.
